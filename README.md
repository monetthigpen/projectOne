  ## About
    This is a website that uses JavaScript, the Septa API, the YouTube API, and moment.js to make a playlist for the user's 
    viewing that lasts approximately for the length of their commute. It uses the input given to do so and the YouTube 
    playlist is randomly selected. This helps entertain the user during a very lull period that usually gets overlooked or 
    under utlized for relaxation and or personal time. The website UI is user friendly to have everything just as a clickable 
    option and then submit the correct information. Upon resubmitting the information you will recieve a new playlist. Since 
    this is a website there's currently nothing to install and it works on load.
